Anubis [weighs the soul of your connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_of_souls) using a sha256 proof-of-work challenge in order to protect upstream resources from scraper bots.

Installing and using this will likely result in your website not being indexed by some search engines. This is considered a feature of Anubis, not a bug.

This is a bit of a nuclear response, but AI scraper bots scraping so aggressively have forced my hand. I hate that I have to do this, but this is what we get for the modern Internet because bots don't conform to standards like robots.txt, even when they claim to.

In most cases, you should not need this and can probably get by using Cloudflare to protect a given origin. However, for circumstances where you can't or won't use Cloudflare, Anubis is there for you.
